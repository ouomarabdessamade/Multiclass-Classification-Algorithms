# Multiclass Classification Algorithms

## Overview
🌟 Welcome to our Multiclass Classification Algorithms Project! 🌟

In this project, we've meticulously implemented a suite of powerful multiclass classification algorithms. Dive into the intricacies of handling multiple classes with precision using the following algorithms:

### One Vs One
Embark on the journey of binary decisions in an intricate dance of "One Vs One" classification. Discover the nuances of decision-making in every possible pairwise combination of classes.

### One Vs All
Unleash the power of "One Vs All" classification, where each class stands alone in the spotlight, competing against the rest. Witness the strategic dance of individual classifiers in this elegant multiclass performance.

### Error-Correcting Output Codes
Delve into the realm of Error-Correcting Output Codes, where precision meets complexity. Experience multiclass classification through three distinct strategies:
- **Exhaustive**: A comprehensive exploration of all possible code combinations.
- **Réseaux Orthogonaux (Orthogonal Networks)**: A sophisticated approach employing orthogonal codes for effective classification.
- **Hadamard**: An enchanting use of Hadamard matrices to crack the code in multiclass classification.
